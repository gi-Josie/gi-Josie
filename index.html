    <h3>Refund</h3>

    <p>Ghost - the human rights-violating blogging platform - I'd like a refund.</p>

    <p>If you are not able to credit my Visa, I can receive email funds transfers at the Proton address you have.</p>

    <h3>Witness</h3>

    <p>My human rights are being violated &ndash; in Canada, of all places.</p>

    <p>Twitter criminals have turned the entire Internet into a giant thug-ocracy of crime.</p>

    <p>For security, I changed my legal name 8-months ago and have yet to receive documentation. Another violation of my 
    rights.</p>

    <p>I want the certificate sent to my current location. And as I had to pay twice to have the documents notarized, I think the
    application fee should be waived to compensate.</p>

    <p>________________________________________________</p>

    <h3>Nihil ex Nihilo</h3>

    <p>I thought I'd start with some music &ndash; one of my favorite tracks from Nicolas Jaar, <a href="https://youtu.be/4mYdawsQt5o" target="_blank">And I Say</a> &ndash; then I can ease into the more serious subjects, like AI and security.</p>

    <p>Welcome to my new online home. I'm still setting-up and I'd like to get a custom domain and maybe a shiny new theme too, but I thought I'd
    stop and say hello while construction is underway.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing was changed, everything was changed, by my having seen the dragon. It's one thing to listen, full of scorn and doubt, to poets' versions of time past and visions of time to come; it's another to know, as coldly and simply as my mother knows her pile of bones, what is. Whatever I may have understood or misunderstood in the dragon's talk, something much deeper stayed with me, became my aura. Futility, doom, became a smell in the air, pervasive and acrid as the dead smell after a forest fire&ndash;my scent and the world's, the scent of trees, rocks, waterways wherever I went.</p>

  <p>But there was one thing worse. I discovered that the dragon had put a charm on me: no weapon could cut me. I could walk up to the meadhall whenever I pleased, and they were powerless. My heart became darker because of that. Now, invulnerable, I was as solitary as one live tree in a vast landscape of coal.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, I misunderstood in the beginning: I thought it an advantage.&rdquo;</p> 

  <p>&ndash; John Gardner, Grendel</p>

<p>I'll refrain from forecasting until I'm actually hired and paid to forecast specific outcomes. Probably safer that way.</p>
